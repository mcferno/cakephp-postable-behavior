 * CakePHP Postable Behavior

 * 
 * Allows you to map data from one or more models to a central model/table
 * which maintains an index of common fields. The resulting set of data can be 
 * manipulated in an abstract fashion, allowing you to blur the differences
 * between different types of data.
 * 
 * Settings:
 * 
 * - storageModel : default 'Post'. 
 *     Name of the model which will be instantiated and used as the storage for 
 *     the common data. This model should never use this behavior.
 * 
 * - mapping :
 *     By default, the field name of all non-essential columns in the 
 *     storage model will be used as-is to find matches in other models using
 *     the behavior. This is used to override the mapping for a specific model.
 * 
 *     Format : array('columnNameInStorageModel' => 'fieldNameInSourceModel')
 * 
 *     If a columnName is assigned `false`, it will be ignored during mapping.
 *     If a columnName is assigned `true`, it will invoke a Model callback to 
 *       handle the data assignment (below).
 * 
 * - mappingCallback : default 'postableMappingCallback'
 *     The model callback function used to map data. This allows the model to 
 *     manipulate the data as needed before it is recorded in the storage model.
 *     To enable this callback, set the mapping to `true` for a column (above)
 *     
 *     Syntax : postableMappingCallback(columnName, modelData);
 * 
 *     The callback should return data for the specific columnName in a saveable
 *     format.
 * 
 * - inclusionCallback : default `null`
 *     The model callback function used to determine whether or not a specific
 *     record should be included in the storage model.
 * 
 *     Syntax : postableInclusionCallback(modelData);
 * 
 *     The callback should return true (use) or false (omit)
